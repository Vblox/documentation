How to display several images per product
=========================================

By default your product web page displays the main image of your product only.
If you like to show your products under several angles, you can turn the image into a carrousel.

.. image:: ./media/multi_images01.png
   :align: center

* Open a product detail form and upload media from *eCommerce* tab. underneath *Extra Product Media* Hit *ADD A MEDIA* in Edit mode to get the upload wizard.

.. note:: 
    Such extra image are common to all the product variants (if any).
